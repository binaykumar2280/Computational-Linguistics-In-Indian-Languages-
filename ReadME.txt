This assignment is done by Abhishek Sahu
In this assignment, I have used Odia as my primary language for Q1 and Q3.
But due to the fact that NER Dataset is not available for Odia in Q2, I have to switch to hindi for that Question

This Assignment is divided into 3 Directory according to the question

Q1
---

In this directory, it contains 2 code file 
Also this also contain one Output directory to represent the output. The Dataset for similarity is used is made by me, so I have given 0/1 instead of ranking. Please consider my work as I don't have significant Dataset. I stored the Accuracy in text file present in each folder.  


Q2
---
The NER Dataset is in HINDI as I don't have ODIA NER Dataset.
In this directory, I have placed the code for Funetuning Of IndicBert on NER Dataset
I have done this fine tuning in Google Colab. Linked will be shared upon asking. So this Code need to directly upload in Google Colab. The Output of Finetuning is available in the Notebook. No Explict Files are provided.

Q3
---

In this directory, it contains 4 file numbered according to the question.
Also this contain one Output directory where I preserved all my outputs.
Also it contain a pickle directory where I kept my pickle files.

All Outputs are in notebooks. So I don't provide explict output for some files.
